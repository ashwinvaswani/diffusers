# Dreambooth for thumbs-up action.

[DreamBooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242) is a method to personalize text2image models like stable diffusion given just a few(3~5) images of a subject.
The `train_dreambooth.py` script shows how to implement the training procedure and adapt it for stable diffusion.

## Running locally with PyTorch

### Installing the dependencies

Before running the scripts, make sure to install the library's training dependencies:

**Important**

To make sure you can successfully run the latest versions of the example scripts, we highly recommend **installing from source** and keeping the install up to date as we update the example scripts frequently and install some example-specific requirements. To do this, execute the following steps in a new virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
```

Then cd in the example folder and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And initialize an [ðŸ¤—Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/) environment with:

```bash
accelerate config
```

Or for a default accelerate configuration without answering questions about your environment

```bash
accelerate config default
```

Or if your environment doesn't support an interactive shell e.g. a notebook

```python
from accelerate.utils import write_basic_config
write_basic_config()
```

When running `accelerate config`, if we specify torch compile mode to True there can be dramatic speedups. 

# Training script:

```bash
sh train.sh
```

# To run inference:

```bash
python3 inference.py
```
